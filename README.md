# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
The dataset used in this project is microscopic biopsy images of breast cancer and microscopic biopsy images of non-cancerous cells derived from the Breast Cancer Histopathological Database (BreakHis). Machine learning and deep learning algorithms are employed, along with image processing techniques. The programming language used is Python, as it contains various libraries for each step, from image preprocessing to classification. For the detection of breast cancer, two distinct CNN architectures were compared. CNN Model 1 employs MaxPooling2D to create three convolution layers with 16, 32, and 64 kernels. CNN Model 2 uses GlobalAveragePooling2D, trained over 30 epochs with a batch size of 16.
